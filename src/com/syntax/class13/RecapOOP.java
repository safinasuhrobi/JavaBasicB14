	/* Classes and objects?
	 * -A class is a Template or Blueprint from which we create the objects.
	 * -An object in programming is very similar to the objects that we have in real life.

	 * Objects have states that defines how the object looks like.
	 * We define the states with the help of Attributes/properties/fields inside a class.
	 * Objects can also have behaviours: (things that object can do)
	 * We use methods to define these behaviours
