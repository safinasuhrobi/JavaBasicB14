		 * String is the most widely used class in Java. It helps us store and manipulate Text based data
		 * 
		 * Why we should learn about String class and its methods?
		 * -> String class has a lot of methods that can help us manipulate the text based data.
		 * -> That way we don't need to write any logic we can simply create the object of the String class and can use the method from that class.
		 * 
		 * Syntax:
		 * -> String str = new String("I can't sleep if I don't solve Repls");
		 * -> String str2 = "I can't sleep if I don't solve Repls";
		 * 	str2.length();
